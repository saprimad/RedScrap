## Summary

Netnography is a qualitative research method used to study online communities and digital interactions. Reddit, with its large user base and topic-specific subreddits, offers a rich source of publicly available content for exploring community discourse, opinions, and behaviors. However, collecting and organizing Reddit data for research purposes can be technically challenging, particularly for researchers unfamiliar with programming or API usage.

**RedScrap** is a lightweight and open-source Python tool designed to streamline Reddit data collection for netnographic and qualitative research. Built using the PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) library, RedScrap allows users to extract structured data from Reddit threads or entire subreddits, including comments and metadata. The tool supports filtering by keyword and date range, enabling targeted data extraction across a wide range of research topics.

RedScrap provides both a command-line interface (CLI) and a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI), making it accessible to researchers with different levels of technical proficiency. The tool outputs data in standard formats (CSV and JSON), making it suitable for integration into qualitative coding workflows, such as thematic analysis, content analysis, and triangulation with other data sources.

RedScrap is designed for researchers in fields such as communication, sociology, digital ethnography, and public policy who seek efficient access to Reddit data. By lowering technical barriers and promoting reproducible practices, RedScrap contributes to the growing ecosystem of open-source tools that support ethical and scalable online research.

## Statement of Need

Researchers in social sciences, digital ethnography, and communication studies increasingly rely on Reddit as a source of user-generated data to understand public opinion, discourse, and community interactions. Despite its value, Reddit data can be difficult to access in a structured form due to the technical complexity of APIs and the lack of user-friendly tools designed specifically for qualitative research workflows.

While existing Reddit scraping tools often prioritize large-scale quantitative data or are built for developers, there is a gap in tools that cater to qualitative researchers who need targeted, flexible, and ethical ways to collect Reddit content. RedScrap addresses this gap by offering an accessible, lightweight Python tool that enables researchers to extract Reddit comments and metadata with minimal setup.

RedScrap supports both code-based and GUI-based workflows, making it suitable for researchers with or without programming experience. It outputs data in standard formats (CSV and JSON), which are easily imported into qualitative analysis software for coding and interpretation.

By lowering the entry barrier to Reddit data collection and aligning with academic research practices, RedScrap meets the growing need for specialized tools that support qualitative and netnographic research in digital environments.

## Installation

To install RedScrap and its dependencies, clone the repository and install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RedScrap.git
cd RedScrap
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

RedScrap requires Python 3.7 or later. It uses the PRAW library for accessing Reddit’s API, along with standard packages for GUI and data export. Make sure to have a valid Reddit API client ID and secret, which can be obtained by registering an application at [https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps).

## Usage

RedScrap can be used in two modes: via a Python script or through a simple graphical user interface (GUI). It allows users to extract Reddit comments and metadata for qualitative research by targeting specific posts, subreddits, keywords, and date ranges.

### Python Script / CLI Usage

Here is a basic example using RedScrap in a Python script:

```python
from redscrap import RedScrap

scraper = RedScrap()
scraper.scrape_post("https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/xxxxx/sample_post/")
scraper.export_to_csv("output.csv")
```

You may also extract data from a subreddit by keyword:

```python
scraper.scrape_subreddit("malaysia", keyword="legalization", limit=100)
```

Before using the script, ensure that your Reddit API credentials are configured (via `.env` or direct variable assignment inside the code, depending on your implementation).

### GUI Usage

RedScrap includes a graphical interface that allows users to collect Reddit data without writing any code. To launch the GUI:

```bash
python gui.py
```

In the GUI:
- Enter a subreddit name (e.g., `malaysia`)
- Specify a keyword (optional)
- Define a date range (optional)
- Click **Search Threads** to view matching threads
- Select a thread and click **Scrape Selected Thread & Save** to export the comments and metadata

The output file will be saved in CSV or JSON format, ready for analysis in software such as Excel, Atlas.ti, NVivo, or any Python-based tools.
